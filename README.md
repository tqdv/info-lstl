A bunch of things related to stuff we do in class.
Help is greatly appreciated.

## dropbox-fetch

It's supposed to recursively fetch files from a public dropbox.

Notes :
- The webpage scraping breaks every now and then
- It's in perl, e.g. I have no idea what I wrote

## siu.pl

Creates a DOT file (for graphviz) from a specific input

Input :
- first line is all the baseunits seperated by whitespace
- following lines are <unitsymbol> followed by their expression in baseunits (e.g. m.s-2)
